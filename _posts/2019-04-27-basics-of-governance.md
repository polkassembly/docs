# Day 0 of Governance

_The art of making decisions_

## What is Governance?

As per [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/governance),

> Governance is the way that organizations or countries are managed at the highest level, and the systems for doing this

So what does Governance mean for Blockchains? Leveraging a one line summary from a brilliant article on Blockchain Governance by [101 Blockchains](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-governance/) -

> Blockchain governance is the idea of managing the ever-changing state of blockchainâ€™s needs and demands.

## What are the kinds of Blockchain Governance?

Blockchain Governance can be classified on two primary criteria - whether they are on chain or off chain.

### On Chain Governance

Simply put, this kind of governance requires all actions around Governance to take place on the blockchain.

- It brings the advantages of blockchain along with it including trust, transparency, and accountability.
- It often times involves leveraging network tokens to determine eligible participants and ensure that everyone that has a stake in the network has a chance to contribute to its decisions.

### Off Chain Governance

This kind of governance takes place informally, away from the primary code of the blockchain.

- Its primary advantages are higher voter turnout and easier processes for non-blockchain native users.
- There is generally no requirement for a network token in this kind of governance and it resembles real-world politics.
