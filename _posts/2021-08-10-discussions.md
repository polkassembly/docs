_Join the conversation_

Polkassembly has been at the forefront for initiating deliberation and discussions on topics critical to the Dotsama's growth and sustenance.

What are Discussions?

At Polkassembly's discussion page, we invite you to engage in meaningful and respectful dialogue on a variety of topics relevant to your network.  
We look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas!

The primary goals of the discussion page are:

- Give the community an opportunity to share their views, before proposals enter into on-chain voting.
- Gauge the community's sentiment and request opinions on a particular topic.
- Community members can seek clarifications around any of the topics mentioned in a respectful manner.
- Leverage detailed opinions to alter the referendum as per the community needs.

> **We encourage all proposers to engage in discussion with the community prior to moving forward with an on-chain referendum.**

# Let's create a discussion!

Can I create a discussion?

Discussion posts can be natively created on Polkassembly **by anyone.**  
There is no requirement for the creator to hold or deposit any tokens.

How do I create a discussion?

1. Use the navigation panel on the extreme left to head over to the discussions tab for the network you have selected.

2. Click on the **Add New Post** button.

3. You can then add the title and description for the post.

4. You can choose to add a poll to your discussion post:

   - A poll is used to gauge off chain community sentiment on a proposal before it goes to voting.
   - This will also lead to creation of a council signal which are off chain votes by council members.

5. You can select a topic to which the discussion post should be tagged. The option which is most relevant to your post should be selected out of the five options.
