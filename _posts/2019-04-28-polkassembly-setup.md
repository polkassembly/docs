The sign up is a simple two step process:

- Provide a username and email address which you would like to use

# User Profile

A user's profile at Polkassembly is representative of their on chain and off chain actions. All profiles for users are public and are 100% transparent.

This helps build accountability for users, as their actions have meaning.

What all can I observe on the profile page for a user?

A user's profile can be broken down into two broad parts:

Identity, Socials & Addresses

1. A user's on chain identity is one of the primary trust symbols on Polkassembly. All verified details for users with on chain identities can be found in the on chain identity section.
2. In addition to this, Polkassembly also shows the latest information on a user's non verified social handles below their username.
3. You can look at all linked addresses of a user in this section, which are leveraged to populate their entire on chain activity.

Activity

The on chain + off chain activity is broken into 4 broad sections:

1. **Collectives** → consisting of Council Motions and Tech Committee Proposals created by the user.
2. **Democracy** → consisting of Proposals and Referenda created by the user.
3. **Discussions** → consisting of all off chain discussion posts created by the user.
4. **Treasury** → consisting of bounties, tips and treasury proposals, all of which are linked to the treasury funding ecosystem, tech and product developments.

With the launch of **OpenGov**,  
You can now find the option to not only look at historical Gov1 data, but also the new data from user activity related to OpenGov!

# Verify your Identity

_A simple & quick way to verify your identity!_

Polkassembly now enables users to verify their on-chain credentials with ease for Polkadot!

Simply click on the profile dropdown in your nav bar & start the process to set / verify your on-chain identity!

### Steps to Verify Your Identity

**Step 1** → Choose the address you would like to set your identity for.

**Step 2** → After ensuring you have the minimum balance, you can proceed forward with adding your display name, legal name & social identities. Once you sign a transaction here, your identity data will be added but you will need to request for judgement.

**Step 3** → You will be required to authorize / prove that you have access to the social handles you have mentioned to request judgement upon them. This is done via basic web2 authorization flows.

**Step 4** → Once you have received judgement, a green check mark will start appearing next to your name across the site indicating that you have a verified identity.
